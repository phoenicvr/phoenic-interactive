Effective Date: July 30, 2025
Last Updated: July 30, 2025

All staff members (including moderators, developers, testers, and administrators) in Seal Runners are expected to act professionally, fairly, and in the best interest of the community. These guidelines exist to ensure that players are treated respectfully and that staff conduct upholds the integrity of Seal Runners.

1. General Expectations
Represent Seal Runners in a professional and respectful manner at all times.

Follow all Terms of Service and Privacy Policy just like any regular player.

Do not abuse any powers or privileges for personal gain, fun, or to harass others.

Set an example in behavior, language, and maturity.

Keep internal information (plans, features, or disciplinary actions) confidential unless approved to share.

2. Moderator Responsibilities
Enforce the rules listed in the Terms of Service fairly and consistently.

Do not issue bans, mutes, or kicks unless a player has clearly violated the rules.

Record evidence (logs, screenshots, or video) for serious actions like bans or permanent mutes.

Do not argue with players. If a situation escalates, step back and report it to a lead staff member or the developer.

Treat every situation without bias, even if you know the player personally.

Use moderation tools only when necessary. Never use them as a joke or for non-enforcement reasons.

3. Developer Responsibilities
Ensure all systems or features added to Seal Runners follow the community guidelines.

Never insert personal backdoors, cheats, or hidden content that affects gameplay unfairly.

Keep testing accounts or tools private and secure.

Communicate with other staff members and the lead developer before making major changes.

4. Inappropriate Use of Power
Examples of staff abuse that will result in demotion or ban:

Banning or muting players without cause or warning

Giving out items, cosmetics, or access to others unfairly

Using staff-only tools in public lobbies without purpose

Leaking private content or confidential information

Harassing or threatening players using your staff position

Ignoring rule-breaking behavior from friends or known players

5. Account Security
Do not share your moderator or developer account with anyone.

If someone else uses your account to abuse powers, you will still be held responsible.

Enable any available security protections (such as platform-level PINs or 2FA).

6. Reporting Misconduct
If you see another staff member breaking the rules or abusing powers, report it directly to the lead developer at:

phoenicinteractive@gmail.com

All reports will be taken seriously and kept confidential.

7. Promotions and Demotions
Promotion Requirements:

The staff member must have been actively contributing for at least 1â€“2 days.

They must never ask for a promotion directly or indirectly. Promotions are earned, not requested.

Demotion Requirements:

A staff member may be demoted if they have broken any staff rule or have been inactive for 4 or more days,
unless they are on an officially approved break.

Evidence or reasoning must be provided before demotion is discussed.

8. Breaks
Staff may request a break from their duties if needed.

All break requests must include a clear reason and be approved directly by Phoenic (main owner).

Staff members on break must not engage in staff responsibilities until their return.

Abuse of the break system (e.g. faking reasons) may result in disciplinary action.

9. Termination
Failure to follow these guidelines may result in:

Temporary or permanent removal from the staff team

Loss of in-game privileges

Bans from Seal Runners depending on the severity of the abuse

10. Final Notes
Staff roles are a privilege, not a right. You are expected to hold yourself to a higher standard than regular players. If you are unsure about a situation, ask first, act second. The goal of every staff action should be to keep Seal Runners fair, fun, and safe for everyone.
